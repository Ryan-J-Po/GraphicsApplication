In this demo, I show off my idea for a shader that uses crosshatching to show how dark shadows are. 
You can also see my custom particle system where I made all the images used in it.

The scene can be navigated by moving and rotating the main camera used for the scene.

-CONTROLS-
W - Move forward
S - Move backward
A - Move left
D - Move right

Left-Mouse - Spawns particle system on cursor location.
Right-Mouse - When pressed and held down, allows the camera to be rotated to 'look' around the scene.
